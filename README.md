Swift v5.7 | [different versions](find-my-swift-version.md) | [Swift.org](https://docs.swift.org) 

Taken from the [official Swift documentation](https://docs.swift.org/swift-book/LanguageGuide/TheBasics.html).

✔️ Editable Swift Xcode .playground files included.

## 🔍 Searchable Swift Documentation

Each section of the official Swift documentation has been converted to:
  
  * 👉 1 README.md `markdown` file. (It's easier to read).
  * 👉🏿 1 Swift Xciode .playground file that's editable and executable.

- 🕊 All official documentation begins with `SWIFTDOCS`. [Try it](https://github.com/MatthewpHarding?tab=repositories&q=SWIFTDOCS).

## 🔍 Simplified Swift Documentation
We are in the process of duplicating the official Swift docs, refactoring them and simplifying the examples. This should make it easier for our students to learn Swift faster and easier!

```Swift
// 🚧👷👷👷🏿‍♀️🚧
// This service / feature is under construction
// 😃
// We aim to simplifiy the docs to make it easier to learn! 🎉
```

## My iOS Development Career
I've been developing iOS apps since the first ever release (2008) and have an enormous amount of experience. I hope I can share this information passing tips & tricks on to the next generation. I've had my career - **it's time for yours!**

## Some Achievements

* Substantially increased profits for London based financial companies
* Created the worlds 1st iPhone, iPad and  Watch apps
* Several apps have been advertised on TV, radio, magazines, newspapers books and Apple's website
* One of the **1st iOS developers in the world**


## Some Quick Tips 💡
1. Study the Swift programming language
2. Learn the language first
3. Learn how to build apps second
4. Learn by writing your own tutorials inside Xcode .playground files
5. Set monthly goals to learn `x` by date `y`
6. Aim to write a complete tutorial (.md files & .playground files) by your set goal
7. Place the tutorial up on your GitHub account (create one) for others to learn too 👍
