## My iOS Developer Career
I've been developing iOS apps since the first ever release (2008) and have an enormous amount of experience. I hope I can share this information passing tips & tricks on to the next generation. I've had my career - **it's time for yours!**
### Achievements 
* Invited to Apple HQ to work on a secret project
* Developer behind the 10 billionth download app on AppStore
* Substantially increased profits for London based financial companies
* Created the worlds 1st iPhone, iPad and  Watch apps
* Several apps have been advertised on TV, radio, magazines, newspapers books and Apple's website
* One of the **1st iOS developers in the world**


## How Can I Grow My Career?
Let's start with a basic philosophy; Move forwards every day. Tomorrow should be better than yesterday. Provide your future self with more assets than you had today - *learn, practice and repeat.*

1. Gain experience *(experience 1st, then money 2nd)*
2. Learn Swift 1st
3. Learn building apps 2nd
4. Collect *Career Things* i.e. Things to mention in an interview about how you improved your previous company or product?
5. **Specialise!** Stop trying to know *everything* and focus on 1 thing - Swift!
6. Be patient and train everyday → [touch typing](https://www.typingstudy.com), [terminal](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/16-terminal-commands-every-user-should-know/), [swift](https://github.com/MatthewpHarding), [learning practices](https://www.jimkwik.com/podcast/kwik-brain-001-learning-anything-faster) etc. 


### Quick Career Tips 💡
1. It's not *your* code it's *the* code
2. Low quality developers get upset in code review (PRs) - high quality developers welcome useful comments
3. We are never *right* or *wrong*. Facts are facts. **Prove** how the system *works*.
4. Swift .playground files provide quick answers
5. Who taught you *how* to learn? What's the name of your teacher? 🤔 My **mentor** → [Jim Kwik](https://www.jimkwik.com/podcast/kwik-brain-001-learning-anything-faster)
